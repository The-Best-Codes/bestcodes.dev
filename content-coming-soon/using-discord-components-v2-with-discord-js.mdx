In March 2025, Discord released Components v2, a great improvement to the message components system. Before Components v2, you could send embeds or text content, but you had very little control over the layout. With the new Components v2, messages are constructed entirely using components. This unified approach eliminates the use of traditional message content and embeds, offering developers greater flexibility in designing message layouts.

Rather than describe to you everything that Discord Components v2 offers, let's learn by example. We'll create a simple bot on Discord using the [Discraft](https://github.com/The-Best-Codes/discraft) bot framework to skip the boilerplate code and focus on the components.

## Creating a Bot

> If you already have a JS Discord bot, you can skip directly to the [Using Components v2](#using-components-v2) section.
