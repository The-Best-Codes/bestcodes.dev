> This article assumes you have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Discord.js.

In March 2025, Discord released Components v2, a great improvement to the message components system. Before Components v2, you could send embeds or text content, but you had very little control over the layout. With the new Components v2, messages are constructed entirely using components. This unified approach eliminates the use of traditional message content and embeds, offering developers greater flexibility in designing message layouts.

Rather than describe to you everything that Discord Components v2 offers, let's learn by example. We'll create a simple bot on Discord using the [Discraft](https://github.com/The-Best-Codes/discraft) bot framework to skip the boilerplate code and focus on the components.

## Creating a Bot

> If you already have a JS Discord bot, you can skip directly to the [Using Components v2](#using-components-v2) section.

First, install the Discraft CLI globally (or skip this step and run it with `npx`). To do this, run:

```bash
npm install -g discraft
```

In this tutorial, we are using Discraft `1.7.7`.
Next, let's initialize a new JavaScript bot using Discraft:

```bash
discraft init
```

Choose the "JavaScript" template when prompted. You can pick any directory name you want (e.g., `components-v2-bot`) by selecting "Custom directory" and typing the desired name.
By the end of this process, you should see some steps like this:

- cd components-v2-bot
- Configure your .env file with your bot token
- `npm run dev` to start the bot in development mode

Follow the instructions to complete the setup process.
Your `.env` file should contain the bot token and ID, which you can obtain after creating a new application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). You should **never share your bot token**.

```bash
cd components-v2-bot
```

```dotenv
# Create a .env file with this content
# From `Bot > Token` | https://discord.com/developers/applications
DISCORD_TOKEN='secret_token_here'
# From `General Information > App ID` | https://discord.com/developers/applications
DISCORD_APP_ID='bot_id_here'
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see a message from the terminal that your bot is online! You can fill in your bot client ID below to get an invite link that you can use to invite the bot to a server:

<DiscordBotInvite />

Note that you should set application command and bot scopes in the Discord Developer Portal before inviting the bot to a server.

### Understanding the Bot Structure

The Discraft JavaScript template automatically created a lot of stuff for us, so let's make sure we understand what's going on.
If we open the project in a code editor, we'll see a lot of directories and files, but for this tutorial, only the `commands` directory is important.

![Discraft JavaScript Template Structure](/image/blog/using-discord-js-cv2/discraft-js-directories.png)

Let's take a look at the `commands/ping.js` file. The file defines a bot command (`/ping`) that responds with "Pong!" when a user runs the command on Discord.

```javascript
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from "discord.js";

export default {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder().setName("ping").setDescription("Ping!"),

  async execute(data) {
    const interaction = data.interaction;
    await interaction.reply("Pong!");
  },
};
```
