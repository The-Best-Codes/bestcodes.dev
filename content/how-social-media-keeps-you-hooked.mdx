If you've ever opened Instagram "just for a minute" and then looked up to discover you've spent an hour scrolling and liking, you're not alone. Social media apps are excellent at keeping you stuck in a cycle of engagement, often without you realizing it. Obviously, this is not accidental, it's by design. The more time you spend on social media platforms, the more money they make through advertisements and data collection.
This article will explain an important contributing factor to social media addiction, the Hooked Model, and will also explore a more general concept that the Hooked Model relies on, FoMO.

First, I want to define the Hooked Model and FoMO so you know what they are, which will help you understand the rest of this article better. Next, I'll give some examples and go more in depth about how the Hooked Model works. At the end, I've included some practical tips to help you break the Hooked cycle.

Let's dive in.

## What is the Hooked Model?

If you're an entrepreneur or marketer, you may have heard about the Hooked Model, but average social media users probably haven't.
I'd say that the Hooked Model is a way to make the causes of addictive behavior (especially in social media) more tangible. Social media platforms induced such behavior _before_ the Hooked Model was coined (in 2014). Others would argue that the Hooked Model doesn't only _describe_ this addictive behavior, but is a new and novel way of _creating_ it. The term "Hooked Model" was coined by [Nir Eyal](https://www.nirandfar.com), a renowned author and investor who has written extensively on the psychology of technology and behavior change.
The Hooked Model consists of four primary stages:

1. **Trigger.** An event or stimulus that prompts a behavior.
2. **Action.** The immediate response to the trigger.
3. **Variable Reward.** A reward, in response to the action that varies in intensity or frequency.
4. **Investment.** The emotional or psychological investment in the behavior, which can lead to a sense of loss or discomfort when the behavior is interrupted.

I'll go into more detail about each stage and give some examples in a bit.

## What is FoMO?

FoMO means "Fear of Missing Out". It's often abbreviated in all caps as well, like "FOMO".
FoMO isn't specific to social media, electronic devices, or even technology in general. A better way to describe what we call FoMO might be "Anxiety of Missing Out".
There's a difference between anxiety and fear. Think about the difference between these scenarios:

- You are walking through a forest and come face to face with a bear. The bear roars at you.
- You usually go out with your friends on the weekend, but this week you can't.

In the first scenario with the bear, you probably feel an acute, immediate fear that triggers a physical reaction (like, perhaps, running for your life?). The second scenario is different. You likely feel anxious or worried about missing out on the experience your friends are having without you, but you're not (hopefully) immediately fearful or in danger of physical harm.
If your phone physically harmed because you forgot to watch YouTube Shorts or "doom-scroll" on X, that would be something like "Physical Pain of Missing Out". Ouch! But since physically harming users is obviously not legal or practical (most people would just quit using their phone altogether at that point), social media instead induces anxiety about missing out on the latest trends, new, or updates from friends. For example, if you don't constantly check Facebook but all your friends do, you'll feel like you're less informed or up-to-date than they are.

## How It's Applied (in Social Media)

Let's take a look at how social media employs the Hooked Model and FoMO to keep users engaged and addicted to their platforms.

### The Hooked Model

Remember the four stages of the Hooked Model? Trigger, Action, Variable Reward, and Investment: A **trigger** to begin using the product, an **action** to satisfy the trigger, a **variable reward** for the action, and some type of **investment** that, ultimately, makes the product more valuable to the user. As the user goes through these phases, he builds habits in the process.[^1]
You might be thinking that all this sounds very plausible in theory, but how is it actually implemented in practice? Here's an example.

Imagine a social media user named John. John thinks "I'm bored and have nothing to do", so he opens up Instagram on his phone. He sees a post from a friend about the friend's new car. Interesting. He likes the post and scrolls down. Another friend made a new record on a video game. John's not interested in video games, so he scrolls right past it. Next a bunch of ads, boring, he skips those too.
At this point in our imaginings, John has a choice. He's seen several boring posts and ads, so he could be tired of the app and close it or he could scroll again in hopes of finding another interesting thing. If John has used Instagram before, he knows that he will eventually find something interesting, and that's what keeps him hooked.
John decides to scroll down more. Wait... a funny cat video! John loves cat videos. He watches it. Lastly, he sees a video from a legal "professional" about a new law that will affect him in some way.

Okay, imaginings over, back to reality. Let's take a look at where each part of the Hooked Model was in the scenario we just saw.
First, the **trigger** was John's boredom and perceived lack of things to do. I say _perceived_ because John didn't actually have nothing to do, but he felt that way for a moment. Social media platforms take advantage of this moment by being first-to-mind.[^2] When you think "I'm bored", Instagram is the first thing that comes to mind to do, so before you think of alternatives, you impulsively open it up.
Next, the **action** that s
