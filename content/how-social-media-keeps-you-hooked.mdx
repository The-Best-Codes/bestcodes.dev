If you've ever opened Instagram "just for a minute" and then looked up to discover you've spent an hour scrolling and liking, you're not alone. Social media apps are excellent at keeping you stuck in a cycle of engagement, often without you realizing it. Obviously, this is not accidental, it's by design. The more time you spend on social media platforms, the more money they make through advertisements and data collection.
This article will explain an important contributing factor to social media addiction, the Hooked Model, and will also explore a more general concept that the Hooked Model relies on, FoMO.

First, I want to define the Hooked Model and FoMO so we know what they are, which will help us understand this article better. Next, I'll give some examples and go more in depth about how the Hooked Model works. At the end, I've included some practical tips to help you break the Hooked cycle.

Let's dive in.

## What is the Hooked Model?

If you're an entrepreneur or marketer, you may have heard about the Hooked Model, but average social media users probably haven't.
I'd say that the Hooked Model is a way to make the causes of addictive behavior (especially in social media) more tangible. Social media platforms induced such behavior _before_ the Hooked Model was coined (in 2014). Others would argue that the Hooked Model doesn't only _describe_ this addictive behavior, but is a new and novel way of _creating_ it. The term "Hooked Model" was coined by [Nir Eyal](https://www.nirandfar.com), a renowned author and investor who has written extensively on the psychology of technology and behavior change.
The Hooked Model consists of four primary stages:

1. **Trigger.** An event or stimulus that prompts a behavior.
2. **Action.** The immediate response to the trigger.
3. **Variable Reward.** A reward, in response to the action that varies in intensity or frequency.
4. **Investment.** The emotional or psychological investment in the behavior, which can lead to a sense of loss or discomfort when the behavior is interrupted.

We'll go into more detail about each stage and give some examples in a bit.

## What is FoMO?

FoMO means "Fear of Missing Out". It's often abbreviated in all caps as well, like "FOMO".
