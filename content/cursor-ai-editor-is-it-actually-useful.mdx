Hi guys! You might have heard a lot about Cursor â€” an editor like VS Code with AI built-in!

In this article, I'll discuss what I think about Cursor, and one alternative that I really love. So, let's get started!

## What is Cursor?

> Note: Both Cursor and VS Code have changed since the publication of this article in 2024.

You might have heard a lot about Cursor but not know what it is. Well, let me explain.
Cursor is a code editor similar to VS Code, but with built-in AI features like an AI chat, AI code autocompletion, and more. Cursor has a free plan, with **2000\*** free code autocompletions and limited access to advanced AI models like `claude-3.5-sonnet` and `gpt-4o`.

> \***Note**: At first, my post said that you received unlimited autocompletions on the free plan. You actually just get 2000 for free, but a 14-day Pro trial...
> See the pricing [here](https://www.cursor.com/pricing) for more info. Thank you [@wrongsideofthetracks](https://dev.to/wrongsideofthetracks) for pointing this out!

## How I Feel About Cursor

I love Cursor because it's unique and innovative. It has AI everywhere, making coding much more efficient and easy.

There are some drawbacks. As a Cursor user on Ubuntu, I experience a lot of bugs and crashes. While the UI is familiar â€” essentially the same as VS Code â€” I don't feel completely confident that Cursor will remain a stable and supported product like VS Code has. Another drawback, which applies to most AI LLM chat with advanced models, is that they send code to a cloud computing service, where the code is processed by an AI. Some encrypt your code before sending it to the server; some don't.

## An Alternative to Cursor

> 2025 edit note: This section is outdated. Codeium has shifted focus and become more of a direct competitor to Cursor named [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com). I recommend trying [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com)!

One of the alternatives to Cursor that I just _love_ is [Codeium](https://codeium.com). Codeium offers AI-powered code completion and supports a wide range of programming languages. It integrates seamlessly with various IDEs and editors, including VS Code. Codeium is known for its speed and accuracy, making it a strong contender for anyone looking to enhance their coding efficiency with AI.
Codeium offers autocompletions, a free AI chat (with your codebase and selection context), and more.

## Summary

Is Cursor useful? For sure!

Is Cursor better than VS Code with AI extensions? Maybe, maybe not. It depends a lot on your preferences, how much you like to use AI, and the project you're working on.

I recommend downloading Cursor to give it a try!
