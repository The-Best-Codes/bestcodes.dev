If you've ever opened Instagram "just for a minute" and then looked up to discover you've spent an hour scrolling and liking, you're not alone. Social media apps are excellent at keeping you stuck in a cycle of engagement, often without you realizing it. Obviously, this is not accidental, it's by design. The more time you spend on social media platforms, the more money they make through advertisements and data collection.
This article will explain an important contributing factor to social media addiction, the Hooked Model, and will also explore a more general concept that the Hooked Model relies on, FoMO.

First, I want to define the Hooked Model and FoMO so you know what they are, which will help you understand the rest of this article better. Next, I'll give some examples and go more in depth about how the Hooked Model works. At the end, I've included some practical tips to help you break the Hooked cycle.

Let's dive in.

## What is the Hooked Model?

If you're an entrepreneur or marketer, you may have heard about the Hooked Model, but average social media users probably haven't.
I'd say that the Hooked Model is a way to make the causes of addictive behavior (especially in social media) more tangible. Social media platforms induced such behavior _before_ the Hooked Model was coined (in 2014). Others would argue that the Hooked Model doesn't only _describe_ this addictive behavior, but is a new and novel way of _creating_ it. The term "Hooked Model" was coined by [Nir Eyal](https://www.nirandfar.com), a renowned author and investor who has written extensively on the psychology of technology and behavior change.
The Hooked Model consists of four primary stages:

1. **Trigger.** An event or stimulus that prompts a behavior.
2. **Action.** The immediate response to the trigger.
3. **Variable Reward.** A reward, in response to the action that varies in intensity or frequency.
4. **Investment.** The emotional or psychological investment in the behavior, which can lead to a sense of loss or discomfort when the behavior is interrupted.

I'll go into more detail about each stage and give some examples in a bit.

## What is FoMO?

FoMO means "Fear of Missing Out". It's often abbreviated in all caps as well, like "FOMO".
FoMO isn't specific to social media, electronic devices, or even technology in general. A better way to describe what we call FoMO might be "Anxiety of Missing Out".[^tofill1]
There's a difference between anxiety and fear. Think about the difference between these scenarios:

- You are walking through a forest and come face to face with a bear. The bear roars at you.
- You usually go out with your friends on the weekend, but this week you can't.

In the first scenario with the bear, you probably feel an acute, immediate fear that triggers a physical reaction (like, perhaps, running for your life?). The second scenario is different. You likely feel anxious or worried about missing out on the experience your friends are having without you, but you're not immediately fearful or especially in danger of physical harm.[^tofill6]
If your phone physically harmed you when you forgot to watch YouTube Shorts or "doom-scroll" on X, that would be something like "Physical Pain of Missing Out". Ouch! Since physically harming users is obviously not legal or practical, social media instead induces anxiety about missing out on the latest trends, news, or updates from friends. For example, if you don't constantly check Facebook but all your friends do, you'll feel like you're less informed or up-to-date than they are.

## How It's Applied (in Social Media)

Let's take a look at how social media employs the Hooked Model and FoMO to keep users engaged and addicted to their platforms.

### The Hooked Model

Remember the four stages of the Hooked Model? A **trigger** to begin using the product, an **action** to satisfy the trigger, a **variable reward** for the action, and some type of **investment** that, ultimately, makes the product more valuable to the user. As the user goes through these phases, he builds habits in the process.[^tofill2]
You might be thinking that all this sounds very plausible in theory, but how is it actually implemented in practice? Here's an example.

Imagine a social media user named John. John thinks "I'm bored and have nothing to do", so he opens up Instagram on his phone. He sees a post from a friend about the friend's new car. Interesting. He likes the post and scrolls down. Another friend made a new high score on a video game. John is not interested in video games, so he scrolls past it. Next a bunch of ads, boring, he skips those too.
At this point in our imaginings, John has a choice. He's seen several boring posts and ads, so he could be tired of the app and close it or he could scroll again in hopes of finding another interesting thing. If John has used Instagram before, he knows that he will eventually find something interesting, and that's what keeps him hooked.
John decides to scroll down more. Wait... a funny cat video! John loves cat videos. He watches it. Lastly, he sees a video from a legal "professional" about a new law that will affect him in some way.

Okay, imaginings over, back to reality. Let's take a look at where each part of the Hooked Model was in the scenario we just saw.
First, the **trigger** was John's boredom and perceived lack of things to do. I say _perceived_ because John didn't actually have nothing to do, but he felt that way for a moment. Social media platforms take advantage of this moment by being first-to-mind.[^tofill3] When you think "I'm bored", Instagram is the first thing that comes to mind to do, so before you think of alternatives, you impulsively open it up.
Next, the **action** that satisfies the trigger is opening Instagram. This is pretty straightforward: John opens Instagram and now he has something to do.
Now for the important part: **variable reward**. In John's case, we can see the variable reward clearly: sometimes he gets boring ads and sometimes he gets interesting content. John might find that posts about his friend's cars are interesting, funny cat videos increase dopamine levels, and legal info gives him a sense of accomplishment (a feeling that he learned something which made Instagram worth his time). But he's not interested in video games or ads. This unpredictability keeps him engaged.
Interestingly, variable rewards have also been shown to be more motivating than fixed rewards for certain animals, such as pigeons.[^tofill4]

> **Why not a fixed reward?**
> Fixed rewards (where the reward is always the same) are less motivating because they create a sense of predictability and boredom. When you know exactly what you're going to get, you're less likely to engage. Fixed rewards systems are more vulnerable to habituation, where the reward becomes less effective over time (which you could also describe as "burnout"). Variable rewards, on the other hand, create a sense of anticipation and excitement; the fluctuation deters burnout.

Lastly, the **investment** is the time spent on, personal information inputted to, and connections made on the platform. The more you invest, the harder it is to stop.
Thus, the cycle continues, and the more the cycle repeats, the more likely it is to become a habit.[^tofill5]

Now, the example of John is a very specific example and there are many other ways that social media can implement each of the four parts of the Hooked Model. I'll give a quick rundown (not exhaustive) below before we move on to exploring how social media manipulates your FoMO to keep you addicted as well.

| Phase               | Implementations                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trigger**         | Notifications, badges, “streaks,” boredom, loneliness, curiosity, social comparison; eventually out of habit |
| **Action**          | Swiping to refresh, infinite scrolling, tapping Stories/Reels/Shorts                                         |
| **Variable Reward** | Viral videos, surprise likes/follows, trending memes, algorithm-curated feeds                                |
| **Investment**      | Posting photos, building followers, liking/commenting, saving playlists                                      |

**TL;DR**: Social media keeps you hooked through triggers, actions, variable rewards, and investments. They want _as many triggers as possible_ to have the best chance of getting you to start using their platform. They make actions as _easy and effortless as possible_ to encourage you to keep taking action. They want to keep you engaged as _long as possible_, generating more revenue for themselves, by using variable rewards. They want you to invest as much _time, effort, and potentially money_ as possible so that you feel like you can't stop.

### Where FoMO Comes In

So, where does FoMO fit in to all this? Two phases: The trigger and the variable reward.

**In the Trigger:** FoMO is a powerful trigger. It motivates you to constantly check your feed, hoping to catch something new and exciting. It's an internal trigger rather than an external one, which makes it extra effective.
An external trigger is easier for you to deal with (e.g., if X is giving you too many notifications, or Facebook keeps emailing you, you can just turn them off). FoMO is internal, a personal feeling that you can't just turn off. It's hard to ignore!

**In the Variable Reward:** FoMO is not quite _directly_ related to the variable reward, but it can amplify its effect. For example, the relief when you see you haven't missed anything, or the comfort that you opened the app just in time to see an important announcement post from 5 minutes ago. It reinforces the feeling that the opposite of being in the know must be much worse than it actually is.

    > Fear is an automatic neurophysiological state of alarm characterized by a fight or flight response to a cognitive appraisal of present or imminent danger (real or perceived). Anxiety is linked to fear and manifests as a future-oriented mood state that consists of a complex cognitive, affective, physiological, and behavioral response system associated with preparation for the anticipated events or circumstances perceived as threatening.
