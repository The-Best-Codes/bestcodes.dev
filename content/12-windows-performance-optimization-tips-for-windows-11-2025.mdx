Feeling like your Windows machine is crawling? Before you throw it out the window (pun intended), try these simple tips to speed things up!

I'll keep things simple, actionable, and beginner-friendly. You don't need to be a tech wizard to do any of these.

## 1. Disable Startup Programs

If you have too many apps launching at boot, they can negatively impact your system's performance.

Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open **Task Manager** or search for it in the Start menu, then go to the **Startup** tab and disable what you don't need.

![Task Manager > Startup Tab](/image/blog/windows-11-performance-tips-2025/startup-apps-task-manager.png)

Right-click on the startup apps you want to disable at startup and select **Disable**.

Don't worry; disabling them here won't uninstall anything, it just stops them from launching automatically.

## 2. Uninstall Bloatware

You'd be surprised how many pre-installed apps or unused software sit around doing nothing but slowing things down. Some run in the background and consume resources silently when you aren't even using them.

Go to **Settings > Apps > Installed Apps** and uninstall junk you never use.

> If you see something that you don't recognize or looks like a development tool, don't uninstall it immediately. Ask someone knowledgeable about it or search about it online to confirm its purpose before uninstalling so you don't accidentally remove system dependencies.

You can also sort the apps by size to identify the biggest ones. They don't necessarily cause the most lag, but they use a lot of disk space.

## 3. Clean Up with Storage Sense or Disk Cleanup

Clear out temporary files, old updates, and recycle bin trash.

- **Storage Sense**: Turn it on in **Settings > System > Storage**.
- Or run **Disk Cleanup** from the start menu for a manual sweep.

## 4. Enable High Performance Mode

Windows likes to save power, which is nice — unless you want speed!

To enable High Performance mode, search "Control Panel" in the Start Menu. Launch it.
Now, follow closely in the next steps. Windows 11 makes it tricky to enable High Performance mode due to environmental efforts.

- Go to **Hardware and Sound** from the Control Panel.

## 🧠 5. Keep Drivers & Windows Updated

Outdated drivers = bugs, crashes, and slowness.

- Check for **Windows Updates** regularly.
- Update GPU drivers using tools like:

  - **NVIDIA GeForce Experience**
  - **AMD Software**
  - **Intel Driver & Support Assistant**

---

## ✨ 6. Adjust Visual Effects for Speed

Fancy animations? Cool, but they slow things down.

👉 Search “**Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows**” in the Start Menu and choose **“Adjust for best performance”** — or manually keep what you like.

## 🚫 7. Turn Off Background Apps

Some apps run in the background for no good reason.

👉 Head to **Settings > Apps > Installed Apps**, click the `...` on an app > **Advanced options** > set Background permissions to **Never**.

> 🖼️ **\[Insert screenshot showing background app permissions]**

---

## 💽 8. Defragment (HDD) or Optimize (SSD)

If you're on a hard drive (HDD), defrag it. If you're on an SSD — don’t. Just optimize.

👉 Search for **"Defragment and Optimize Drives"**, and optimize your main drive.

> 🖼️ **\[Insert screenshot of the optimization window]**

---

## 🛡️ 9. Use a Lightweight Antivirus

Windows Defender is honestly solid now. If you have a heavy third-party antivirus slowing things down, consider switching back to the built-in one.

---

## 🧼 10. Scan for Malware

Lag can also mean you're infected.

I recommend:

- **Windows Defender Full Scan**
- **Malwarebytes**
- **AdwCleaner** (great for browser junk)

---

## 🔧 11. Upgrade Your Hardware (if you can)

- **RAM**: At least 8GB, but 16GB is the sweet spot.
- **SSD**: If you’re still on a spinning hard drive... get an SSD. Huge difference.

---

## 🎮 12. Turn on Game Mode (Gamers Only)

Game Mode tells Windows to chill out on background stuff while you’re playing.

👉 Go to **Settings > Gaming > Game Mode** and toggle it on.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

A laggy PC doesn’t always mean it’s dying. Most of the time, it’s just bogged down with junk or background apps. Try a combo of the tips above — even just 3 or 4 can make a _huge_ difference.
