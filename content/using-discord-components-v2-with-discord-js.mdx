In March 2025, Discord released Components v2, a great improvement to the message components system. Before Components v2, a bot could send embeds or text, but it had very limited control over the layout. With Components v2, messages are constructed entirely using components. This unified approach eliminates the use of traditional message content and embeds, offering developers greater flexibility in designing message layouts.

Rather than describing everything Components v2 offers, let's learn by example. We'll create a simple bot using the [Discraft](https://github.com/The-Best-Codes/discraft-js) bot framework, a lightweight CLI for bootstrapping Discord.js bots that will do all the boilerplate work for us so we can focus on building components.
(Or, if you just want to know what changed in Components v2, you can skip to the [TL;DR](#tldr) 😉)

> Note: This article assumes you have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Discord.js. Also, while the article primarily focuses on using Components v2 with application commands, you can use the same techniques with text messages!

## Creating a Bot

> If you already have a Discord.js bot, you can skip directly to the [Components v2 with Discord.js](#components-v2-with-discordjs) section. However, the tutorial assumes that your bot is using the [Discraft](https://github.com/The-Best-Codes/discraft-js) bot framework, so you may need to modify some of the code examples to fit your bot's structure.

First, install the Discraft CLI globally (or skip this step and run it with `npx`). Run:

```bash
npm install -g discraft
```

In this tutorial, we are using Discraft `1.7.7`.
Next, let's initialize a new JavaScript bot using Discraft:

```bash
discraft init
```

When prompted, choose the "JavaScript" template. Then, name the directory whatever you'd like (e.g., components-v2-bot) by selecting "Custom directory".
At the end of the initialization process, Discraft should give you some steps like this:

- cd components-v2-bot
- Configure your .env file with your bot token
- `npm run dev` to start the bot in development mode

You should follow the instructions to complete the setup process:

```bash
cd components-v2-bot
```

Your `.env` file should contain the bot token and ID, which you will receive after creating a new bot application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). You should **never share your bot token**.

```dotenv
# Create a .env file with this content
# From `Bot > Token` | https://discord.com/developers/applications
DISCORD_TOKEN='secret_token_here'
# From `General Information > App ID` | https://discord.com/developers/applications
DISCORD_APP_ID='bot_id_here'
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see some logs in the terminal confirming that your bot is online! Fill in your bot's Client ID below to get an invite link and invite the bot to a server:

<DiscordBotInvite />

> Don't forget to set `application command` and `bot` scopes in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) before inviting the bot to a server. Also remember that you must have the "Manage Server" permission to invite bots to a server.

### Understanding the Bot Structure

The Discraft JavaScript template automatically created several files and folders for us, so let's make sure we understand what's going on.
If we open the project in a code editor, we'll see a lot of directories and files, but for this tutorial, the most important is the `commands` directory.
The `index.js` file is the entry point for the bot, where all the other files come together. If you ran `npm run dev` or `npm run build` earlier, you will also find a `.discraft` folder. It contains command and event index files to automatically register commands and events with Discord when your bot starts up.

![Screenshot of a code directory structure named "components-v2-bot" with subdirectories ".discraft", "clients", and "commands", and JavaScript files "longcommand.js", "messageinfo.js", "ping.js" (selected), and "userinfo.js".](/image/blog/using-discord-js-cv2/discraft-js-directories.png)

Let's take a look at the `commands/ping.js` file. It defines an application command (`/ping`) that responds with "Pong!" when a user runs the command on Discord.

```javascript
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from "discord.js";

export default {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder().setName("ping").setDescription("Ping!"),

  async execute(data) {
    const interaction = data.interaction;
    await interaction.reply("Pong!");
  },
};
```

When the bot starts, it will register a `ping` slash command on Discord. If we type `/` in the Discord message box, we'll see a list of bot commands we can run. This image shows what part of the code corresponds to different parts of the Discord command UI:

![Discord messages showing bot configuration for a ping command.](/image/blog/using-discord-js-cv2/ping-command-demo.png)

Now that we understand how the slash commands are defined, let's update the ping command to use Components v2!

## Components v2 with Discord.js

> Components v2 was recently introduced into Discord.js. This tutorial assumes you are using Discord.js `14.19.3` or later. To make sure you have the latest version, run `npm install discord.js@latest` in your project directory.

The first step in migrating to Components v2 is to add the `IsComponentsV2` flag to our bot interaction response. This flag tells Discord.js to use Components v2 instead of the older version.

```javascript
import { MessageFlags } from "discord.js";

// ...

await interaction.reply({
  content: "Pong!",
  flags: MessageFlags.IsComponentsV2,
});
```

If we try to use the ping command at this point, nothing will happen (or the bot will have an error) because we need an array of components to pass to the `content` field and not plain text. So let's update our file again:

```javascript
import {
  MessageFlags,
  SlashCommandBuilder,
  TextDisplayBuilder,
} from "discord.js";

export default {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder().setName("ping").setDescription("Ping!"),

  async execute(data) {
    const interaction = data.interaction;

    const components = [new TextDisplayBuilder().setContent("Pong!")];

    await interaction.reply({
      components: components,
      flags: MessageFlags.IsComponentsV2,
    });
  },
};
```

That might seem pretty boring at first. It does the same thing as our ping command did earlier, just using more code. However, you might have noticed something important: the `components` constant is an array, so we can put text, buttons, or whatever we want in _whatever order we want_. We're no longer limited to just embeds or action rows at the _end_ of our messages!
Let's add more components to see it in action:

```javascript
import {
  ContainerBuilder,
  MessageFlags,
  SeparatorBuilder,
  SeparatorSpacingSize,
  SlashCommandBuilder,
  TextDisplayBuilder,
} from "discord.js";

export default {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder().setName("ping").setDescription("Ping!"),

  async execute(data) {
    const interaction = data.interaction;

    const components = [
      new TextDisplayBuilder().setContent("Pinging..."),
      new ContainerBuilder().addTextDisplayComponents(
        new TextDisplayBuilder().setContent("Ping? Pong? Ping?"),
      ),
      new SeparatorBuilder()
        .setSpacing(SeparatorSpacingSize.Small)
        .setDivider(true),
      new TextDisplayBuilder().setContent("Pong!"),
    ];

    await interaction.reply({
      components: components,
      flags: MessageFlags.IsComponentsV2,
    });
  },
};
```

The result:

Let's try something a bit more advanced. We'll recreate that select menu you see in the thumbnail of this blog post!

First, create a new file named `select-food.js` in the `commands/` folder. Add this content to the file:

```javascript
import {
  ActionRowBuilder,
  MessageFlags,
  SlashCommandBuilder,
  StringSelectMenuBuilder,
  StringSelectMenuOptionBuilder,
  TextDisplayBuilder,
} from "discord.js";

export default {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName("select-food")
    .setDescription("Choose a food to eat :D"),

  async execute(data) {
    const interaction = data.interaction;

    const components = [
      new TextDisplayBuilder().setContent("Which food would you like to eat?"),
      new ActionRowBuilder().addComponents(
        new StringSelectMenuBuilder()
          .setCustomId("discraft-select-a-food")
          .setPlaceholder("Make a selection")
          .addOptions(
            new StringSelectMenuOptionBuilder()
              .setLabel("Taco")
              .setValue("dsaf-taco")
              .setDescription("(best option)")
              .setEmoji({
                name: "🌮",
              }),
            new StringSelectMenuOptionBuilder()
              .setLabel("Pizza")
              .setValue("dsaf-pizza")
              .setEmoji({
                name: "🍕",
              }),
            new StringSelectMenuOptionBuilder()
              .setLabel("Burger")
              .setValue("dsaf-burger")
              .setEmoji({
                name: "🍔",
              }),
          ),
      ),
    ];

    await interaction.reply({
      components: components,
      flags: MessageFlags.IsComponentsV2,
    });
  },
};
```

After you add a new command, save the file and restart your bot. If you are using the `npm run dev` command from Discraft, your bot will automatically reload for you. You might also need to reopen Discord or refresh your slash command cache (Ctrl+R on desktop) for the new command to appear.

Run the `select-food` command and you will see a select menu with options just like we set in the file!

![Discord message from Discraft app asking "Which food would you like to eat?" with options to select taco, pizza, or burger.](/image/blog/using-discord-js-cv2/taco-best-option.png)

The select menu interaction will fail if you actually make a selection, because we haven't told the bot how to handle the interaction yet. We can easily add an `interactionCreate` event listener to handle the select menu interactions.
Simply create a new file named `interactionCreate.js` in the `events/` folder:

```javascript
import { Events, MessageFlags } from "discord.js";
import { logger } from "../utils/logger";

export default {
  event: Events.InteractionCreate,
  handler: async (_client, interaction) => {
    if (!interaction.isAnySelectMenu()) return;

    if (interaction.customId === "discraft-select-a-food") {
      const selectedValue = interaction.values[0];

      let foodName = "";
      switch (selectedValue) {
        case "dsaf-taco":
          foodName = "Taco";
          break;
        case "dsaf-pizza":
          foodName = "Pizza";
          break;
        case "dsaf-burger":
          foodName = "Burger";
          break;
        default:
          foodName = "Unknown food";
      }

      try {
        await interaction.reply({
          content: `You selected: ${foodName}! Great choice!`,
          flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral, // Only the user who interacted with the menu can see this message
        });
      } catch (error) {
        logger.error(`Error replying to select menu interaction: ${error}`);
      }
    }
  },
};
```

Now, when you select a food, the bot will respond with a follow-up message!

![Screenshot of a Discord chat showing a bot asking "Which food would you like to eat?" with a dropdown menu showing "Taco". The user then selects "Taco" and the bot replies "You selected: Taco! Great choice!".](/image/blog/using-discord-js-cv2/taco-selected.png)

## Conclusion

That's pretty much it... you're now ready to build richer, better bot interactions!
Migrating to Components v2 with Discord.js is fairly easy. If you are curious about all the new components, you can see the [list of available components on the Discord API Docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/components/reference). And don't forget to check out [discord.builders](https://discord.builders/discordjs-javascript-code-generator), which makes it super easy to mock up messages with Components v2.

### TL;DR

The table below shows a quick summary of the main changes between Components v1 and v2:

| Feature         | v1 (Old)                        | v2 (New)                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Layout control  | Limited to embeds & action rows | Full control with flexible layouts |
| Message content | Text or embed                   | Fully component-based              |
| Buttons/Selects | Separate from message body      | Integrated inline with text        |
